Challenge 5: Work Day Scheduler 

My Task is to create a simple calendar application that will allow a 
user to save events reach hour of the day (must run in browser and dynamically update).

Application Requirements:

-	The current day must be displayed at the top of the calendar.
-	User is presented with time blocks for standard business hours during 
    scroll downs.
-	Each block must be color coordinated to indicated "past", "present" and "future".
-	User can enter a new event on “click call”, and must be able to save their events.
-	Local Storage must be utilized accordingly.


       - Starter Code is provided and Moment.js can be used to handle functionailty and or
         alternate solutions since Moment.js is now considered "legacy".
